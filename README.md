# Gatekeeper

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/ambv/black)

Gatekeeper is open source, lightweight JWT-based authentication server for passwordless
SMS phone verification.
Users signup to your service by entering an SMS code, generating an access token which
can be verified by your application without requiring database lookups.
Persistent sessions are supported with refresh tokens.

### Self Hosting

Gatekeeper is a Dockerized Python Django app.

The easiest way to get started is to pull the Gatekeeper image from `benmoose/gatekeeper`. 
Alternatively, you might build your own image from this repository, or run the app directly
on a server without Docker at all.

#### Gatekeeper Docker Image

The official Gatekeeper image lives on Docker Hub.

```bash
docker pull benmoose/gatekeeper
```

The quickest way to get started is to pull that image and expose it to the internet from
behind a web server (e.g. Nginx).

##### Configuring Gatekeeper with Nginx

The Gatekeeper image listens for incoming requests at unix socket `/var/tmp/shared-mount/gunicorn.sock`.
To run Gatekeeper with Nginx, you'll need to tell Nginx to send requests to that unix socket.

To do that, you'll need something like this in your Nginx config.

```
http {
    upstream gatekeeper {
        server unix:/var/tmp/shared-mount/gunicorn.sock;
    }
    
    server {
        location / {
            proxy_pass  http://gatekeeper;
        }
    }
}
```

There's a full reference nginx.conf at [`operations/nginx/nginx.conf`](/operations/nginx/nginx.conf).

When configuring your docker containers, ensure that `/var/tmp/shared-mount/gunicorn.sock`
is a shared volume so both your Gatekeeper and Nginx containers can communicate.
(See [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) for an example.)

### Contributing

Docker is recommended for local development.

##### Useful Scripts

With it installed, you can use the scripts in `dev/` to run common commands
- `dev/test.sh [pytest-args]` 路 run the test suite, all arguments are passed through to pytest
- `dev/manage.sh [command]` 路 run a Django management command
- `dev/fmt.sh [--check]` 路 lint Python code
- `dev/psql.sh` 路 run psql on the DB container, the DB container needs to be running for this command to work

##### Running a Local Server

To run a local version of the production app, run

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

The local server signs and verifies JWTs using the RSA keys in `__fixtures__/`.

Configure the local server (e.g. Twilio credentials) by setting the relevant variables in `.local.env`.
Take care not to commit changes to this file though!

The local server listens at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
You can set a different port by setting the `SERVICE_PORT` environment variable.

```bash
$ SERVICE_PORT=4040 docker-compose up
```
